# Microsoft Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using Microsoft Graph (Swift)

Connecting to Microsoft Office 365 is the first step every iOS app must take to start working with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and then call one API through Microsoft Graph (previously named Office 365 unified API).

> Note: For the Objective-C version of this sample, see [O365-iOS-Microsoft-Graph-Connect](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-iOS-Microsoft-Graph-Connect). Also, try out the [Get started with Office 365 APIs](http://dev.office.com/getting-started/office365apis?platform=option-ios#setup) page, which simplifies registration so you can get this sample running faster.
 
## Prerequisites
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple
* Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)  as a dependency manager.
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case, use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.Mic
* A Microsoft Azure Tenant to register your application. Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > Important: You'll also need to ensure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this, see the Active Directory Team's Blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The **Adding a new directory** section will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
      
* A client id (application id) and redirect uri values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted the **Send mail as user** permission for **Microsoft Graph**. To create the registration, see [Grant permissions to the Connect application in Azure](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-rest-sample/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Connect-application-in-Azure).


       
## Running this sample in Xcode

1. Clone this repository
2. Use CocoaPods to import the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) iOS dependency:
        
	     pod 'ADALiOS', '= 1.2.4'

 This sample app already contains a podfile that will get the ADAL components (pods) into  the project. Simply navigate to the project root, from **Terminal** and run: 
        
        pod install
        
   For more information, see **Using CocoaPods** in [Additional Resources](#AdditionalResources)
  
3. Open **O365-iOS-Microsoft-Graph-Connect-Swift.xcworkspace**
4. Open **AuthenticationConstants.swift**. You'll see that the **ClientID** (application id you received from the registration process in the prerequisites section) and **RedirectUri** values can be added to the top of the file. Supply the necessary values here:

        // You will set your application's clientId and redirect URI.
    	static let ClientId = "ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    	static let RedirectUri = NSURL.init(string: "ENTER_YOUR_REDIRECT_URI")
    	static let Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
    	static let ResourceId = "https://graph.microsoft.com"
    

5. Run the sample.
